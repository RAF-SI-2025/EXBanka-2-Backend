-- =============================================================================
-- SQLC queries for actuary_info — bank-service
-- Run `sqlc generate` from services/bank-service/ to regenerate Go code.
--
-- Naming convention:
--   :one   → returns a single row  (sql.ErrNoRows if not found)
--   :exec  → returns no rows       (only checks for execution error)
--   :many  → returns []Row

-- sqlc.narg() generates a sql.NullString parameter so the IS NULL predicate
-- works correctly from Go without resorting to raw *sql.DB queries.
--
-- Note: user-side filters (email, first_name, last_name, position) are
-- cross-service attributes resolved at the application layer after this query.
